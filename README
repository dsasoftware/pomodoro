# Pomodoro Rails

## Goals

### Personal Goals

1. To get back into rails and ruby.  I don't spend enough time here.
2. To use rails 3.1 and the assets pipeline.
3. To learn Backbone.js.
4. To write tests.

    "I am not a great programmer.  I am just a good programmer, with great habits." -- Kent Beck

### Project Goals

1. To be unobtrusive javascript.  A webcrawler should be able to crawl the site.
2. To be simple and clean.

## Desired Features

1. A backlog List
2. Todo Today List
3. Ability to Estimate Work
4. A timer that is "wound up"
5. Ability to track internal and external interruptions.
6. A graph that can be printed and emailed.
7. A simple REST based api so that other applications can interface.

## Ideas I am toying with

1. Socket based timer.  This would allow the user to 'accidently' close the page and come back without losing the pomodoro.
2. Allow team based timers.  This would involve sockets as well.
